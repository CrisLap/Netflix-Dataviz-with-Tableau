Starting from here, create one or more dashboards to describe your insights clearly and focus on the points you find most interesting. 
You can try to propose a strategy for a show based on your exploration of the data.
With the dataset, you will need to import the data into Tableau Public and create one or more dashboards to show  KPIs and your insights.
